# 3320VCF
Kicad project files of a CEM/AS3320 based VCF

Designed to work with +/- 15V, but will most likely work fine for +/- 12V as well

No PCB-mounting of potmeters, switches, jacks; all connected by pin header connectors

Stages 1 and 2 switchable between HP and LP by SW1 and SW2 
Stages 3 and 4 fixed on LP
These allow for the following filter modes:
A: 24dB LP
B: 12dB BP
C: 6dB HP + 18dB LP
D: 6dB LP + 6dB HP + 12dB LP
Backgroud of the mode configurations: https://electricdruid.net/multimode-filters-part-1-reconfigurable-filters/ section Craig Andertonâ€™s Multiple Identity Filter

Capacitors on pin 4, 5, 11 and 16 should be 1% or less tolerance!
